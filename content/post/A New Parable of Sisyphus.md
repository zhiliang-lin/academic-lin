So, the story goes that the gods finally called off Sisyphus's punishment and set him free. He felt totally reborn! He immediately started trying to do all the things he'd been dreaming about back when he was stuck pushing that rock.

But after a while, he started to get bored with... well, everything. This new, absolute freedom was just too much for him to handle. He'd wake up every morning and have no clue how to face the day.

And so, what did he do? He chose to go back to the stone. He went back to pushing it up the mountain, watching it roll down, and then doing it all over again.

He wasn't upset or disappointed by the repetition anymore. When he was at the bottom, he knew his job was to get the stone to the top. When he was at the top, watching it roll back down, he knew he was about to head down and start over.

At least knowing what he had to do next made him feel grounded. He no longer felt that empty, confused feeling he had before.
