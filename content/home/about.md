# Biography

Hello, my name is Zhiliang Lin (林志良 :sound: [listen](http://www.zhilianglin.com/files/zhiliang-lin.ogg)). I am a quantitative researcher passionate about applying computational methods to understand human communication. 

Currently, I am completing a Master of Science in Statistical Data Analysis at Ghent University to deepen my expertise in advanced quantitative methodologies. Prior to my studies in Belgium, I was a university lecturer at Guangzhou Nanfang College, where I designed and taught courses in statistics for communication, new media data analysis, and web scraping. I also served as a Research Associate at Shenzhen University, contributing to several data-intensive projects and co-authoring publications in SSCI-indexed journals.

Outside academia, I enjoy a variety of pursuits including reading, running, gardening, and playing football.
