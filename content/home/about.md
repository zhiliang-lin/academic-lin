# Biography

My name is Zhiliang Lin (林志良 :sound: [listen](http://www.zhilianglin.com/files/zhiliang-lin.ogg)). Currently, I serve as a Teaching Assistant at Guangzhou Nanfang College. Prior to this role, I worked as a Research Assistant under [Guangchao Charles Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zoqsgEsAAAAJ&hl) at Shenzhen University. I earned my master's degree from Jinan University (Guangzhou) and my bachelor's degree from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.at Shenzhen University. 

I am deeply interested in utilizing quantitative methods to investigate human communication phenomena. With hands-on experience in numerous academic projects, I have (co)authored several papers in both English and Chinese. I am fervent about leveraging various tools to enhance my research, including R, Python, Ucinet, and CiteSpace.

Outside of academia, I am an avid football enthusiast and a fan of [*The Story of the Stone*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/175344). If my name is difficult to pronounce, feel free to call me *Stoner*.
