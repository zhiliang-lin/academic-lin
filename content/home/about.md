# Biography

🎉Hi, my name is Zhiliang Lin<p> (林志良🔈<audio id="namePronunciation" src="http://www.zhilianglin.com/files/zhiliang-lin.ogg"></audio>  <a href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('namePronunciation').play(); return false;">listen</a>)</p>. I am a quantitative researcher who loves using statistical and computational methods to understand social science issues. 

I am currently undertaking a [Subsequent Master of Science in Statistical Data Analysis](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2026/master-of-science-in-statistical-data-analysis-en) at Ghent University to improve my knowledge of advanced quantitative methods. I have six years of work experience, including working as a Teaching Associate at Guangzhou Nanfang College and a Research Associate at Shenzhen University. I have a B.A. in Journalism from the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics and an M.A. in Communication from Jinan University.

Outside of academia, I enjoy reading, running, gardening, and football. And I'm a big fan of the Chinese classic novel *[The Story of  the Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber)* and the football club Bayern Munich.
