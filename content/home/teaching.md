When serving as an instructor at Guangzhou Nanfang College, I have designed and taught the following courses:

* ### [Statistics for Communication Studies](https://github.com/zhiliang-lin/statistics-for-communication-studies)
    A foundational course in quantitative research for communication and social science students. The curriculum covers core concepts from descriptive statistics to regression analysis, with a hands-on focus on using SPSS and Python to prepare students for independent data analysis.

* ### [New Media Data Analysis](https://github.com/zhiliang-lin/new-media-data-analysis)
    A practical introduction to the full data science workflow. This tool-oriented course uses advanced Excel, including Power Query and Power Pivot, to teach students how to import, clean, model, and visualize new media data.

* ### [Web Data Scraping](https://github.com/zhiliang-lin/web-data-scraping)
    A hands-on course on web data collection for research. Students progress from simple tools to advanced Python techniques, learning to extract data from both static pages and complex, dynamic sites using libraries like `pyquery` and `Selenium`.
