When serving as an instructor at Guangzhou Nanfang College, I have designed and taught the following courses:

* ### Statistics for Communication Studies
    This course introduces fundamental statistical concepts and their application in communication research, covering descriptive statistics, probability, inference, regression, and ANOVA using Excel, SPSS and Python.

* ### New Media Data Analysis
    This course focuses on analyzing data from digital platforms. Students learn to handle APIs, process textual data, and apply analytical techniques like sentiment analysis and topic modeling to understand online communication.

* ### Web Data Scraping
    A practical, hands-on course where students learn to collect data from the web using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy, while also covering the ethical considerations of data collection.
