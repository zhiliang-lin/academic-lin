When worked at Guangzhou Nanfang College, I have taught the following courses. Sample materials can be found on the linked GitHub repositories:

* ### [Statistics for Communication Studies](https://github.com/zhiliang-lin/statistics-for-communication-studies)
    The course covers statistical concepts from descriptive statistics to regression analysis. Students are taught to use Excel, SPSS and Python to learn and practice statistics.

* ### [New Media Data Analysis](https://github.com/zhiliang-lin/new-media-data-analysis)
    
    This is a tool-oriented course, students are taught to analyze new media data using  Excel functions, Power Query and Power Pivot.
    
* ### [Web Data Scraping](https://github.com/zhiliang-lin/web-data-scraping)
    Starting from using simple tools, this course in the later part used Python to extract data from both static pages and dynamic sites using libraries like `pyquery` and `Selenium`.
