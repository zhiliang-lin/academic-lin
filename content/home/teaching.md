When serving as an instructor at Guangzhou Nanfang College, I have designed and taught the following courses:

* ### Statistics for Communication Studies
    This course is designed to build a solid foundation in quantitative research methods for students in communication and the social sciences. Blending theory with hands-on application, the curriculum systematically covers core concepts from descriptive statistics to regression analysis. Students learn to process, analyze, and interpret data using modern statistical software like SPSS and Python, culminating in an independent empirical data analysis report.

* ### New Media Data Analysis
    This course provides students with a practical, tool-oriented introduction to the entire data science workflow, with a focus on new media data. The curriculum covers the essential stages of data analysis: importing and cleaning data, modeling and analysis, visualization, and communication of results. Students gain hands-on proficiency in advanced Excel (with Power Query and Power Pivot).

* ### Web Data Scraping
    This course is a hands-on guide to web data collection for research. Students learn to extract data from any web source, starting with simple tools for static pages and progressing to advanced techniques for dynamic sites using Python libraries like pyquery and Selenium.
